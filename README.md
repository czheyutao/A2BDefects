**A High-Resolution Dataset for Internal Structural Defect Analysis in Heritage Conservation**

![Dataset Samples](samples.png)

## Context üåç
This dataset addresses the critical gap in machine learning applications for cultural heritage preservation by focusing on **internal load-bearing brick defects** in ancient architectures (11th-19th century). Developed in collaboration with preservation experts, it enables precise analysis of concealed deterioration patterns through:

- High-fidelity RGB imagery under diverse environmental conditions
- Multi-level annotations (bounding boxes + pixel-level masks)
- Structural severity scoring based on conservation engineering principles

## Key Features ‚ú®
